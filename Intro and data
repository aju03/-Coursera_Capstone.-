#1.Identifying the Business Problem 
Toronto is one of the most densely populated areas in Canada. Toronto is the financial center of Canada and it brings in a plethora of people from different countries. With an estimated population of over 6 million, Toronto is one of the largest cities in Canada with a diverse population. Downtown Toronto is a place where people can view the best of each culture, either while they work or just passing through. 
The objective of this project is to use Foursquare location data and regional clustering of venue information to determine what might be the ‘best’ neighborhood in Toronto to open a Gym/Fitness Center.  Physical activity and exercises are important for everyone.  Regular exercise and physical activity promote strong muscles and bones. It improves respiratory, cardiovascular health, and overall health. Staying active can also help you maintain a healthy weight, reduce your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and reduce your risk for some cancers. Through this project, we will find the most suitable location for an entrepreneur to open a new Gym/Fitness Center in Toronto, Canada.
